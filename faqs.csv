Question,Answer
What is machine learning?,"Machine learning is a branch of AI that allows systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed."
What are supervised and unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning uses labeled data while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data."
How do I start learning AI?,"Start with Python, then learn libraries like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, followed by ML algorithms using scikit-learn."
What is deep learning?,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data."
What are some AI project ideas for beginners?,"Try loan prediction, emotion detection from text, digit recognition using MNIST, or a smart chatbot."
What is natural language processing?,"NLP is the ability of a computer to understand, interpret, and generate human language."
What are some good datasets for ML?,"Try UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, or open datasets like MNIST, Titanic, or Iris."
What is overfitting?,"Overfitting is when a model learns training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data."
What is computer networking?,"Networking is connecting systems to share data/resources. It uses layers and protocols like TCP/IP."
What is the OSI model?,"OSI model has 7 layers to standardize communication: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application."
What is the difference between TCP and UDP?,"TCP is reliable and slower (used for email, web), while UDP is faster but less reliable (used in video streaming, games)."
What are IP and MAC addresses?,"IP address is your system's network address. MAC is a hardware ID of your network interface card."
What is DNS?,"DNS stands for Domain Name System. It translates domain names into IP addresses."
What are common networking tools?,"Ping, Traceroute, Wireshark, and netstat are common tools for diagnostics and analysis."
What is a router vs a switch?,"Routers connect networks (like internet to home), switches connect devices within the same network."
What is Python used for?,"Python is a general-purpose language used for web development, AI/ML, automation, data science, and scripting."
What are Python libraries for ML?,"scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, pandas, and NumPy are the most used ML libraries."
How do I install libraries in Python?,"Use pip in terminal. Example: pip install pandas"
What is Jupyter Notebook?,"It's an interactive coding environment often used in data science and ML for mixing code, text, and visuals."
What is a good first tech project?,"BMI calculator, to-do list, calculator app, or a portfolio website using HTML/CSS/JS or Streamlit."
What is Streamlit?,"Streamlit is a Python library that lets you quickly build interactive web apps for data science and ML projects."
What are some beginner ML projects?,"Iris flower classification, diabetes predictor, house price prediction, or movie recommendation systems."
What is GitHub?,"GitHub is a platform to store, share, and collaborate on code. It also showcases your work to recruiters."
How do I improve my resume?,"Add projects with links, use strong action words, include tech stack, and tailor it for each opportunity."
How can I prepare for tech interviews?,"Practice DSA in C++/Python, solve aptitude problems, and revise core subjects like OS, DBMS, CN."
How to manage time during placement prep?,"Make a weekly plan balancing coding, aptitude, and project work. Avoid multitasking during focus hours."
What if I feel lost in tech?,"It's normal! Focus on small consistent steps. Build one project at a time and track your growth."
Can you motivate me?,"You're not behind. You're building your version of success. Small efforts daily → big wins later ✨"
What should I do when I'm stuck?,"Break the task into smaller chunks, ask ChatGPT, check Stack Overflow, or take a 10-min break and return with fresh eyes."
How do I stay consistent?,"Pick a small daily tech habit: 1 coding Q + 1 project update + 1 thing you learned. Don't aim for perfect, aim for progress."
